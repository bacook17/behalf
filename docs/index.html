								<h2>Introduction: N-Body Problem</h2>
								<p>The N-body problem broadly describes the problem of predicting the future trajectories of a group of objects under the mutual gravitational forces they exert on one another, given each individual object's current position and velocity. The first general formulation of the N-body problem was proposed by Newton when he was studying the motions of Jupiter and its moons (<a href="#Citations">Newton 1687</a>). In Astronomy, the N-body problem has been studied at a wide variety of scales: ranging from the study of asteroids near Jupiter (<a href="#Citations">Brož et al. 2008</a>) to the study of the largest gravitationally bound clusters in the Universe (<a href="#Citations">Angulo et al. 2012</a>). </p>

								<p>For our project, we will be focusing on an intermediate regime: the evolution of galaxies. The fundamental resolution unit in the study of galaxies is a star; stars are born out of the cold and dense gas inside the galaxy, and they move around the galaxy due to the forces exerted by hundreds of billions of other stars in the galaxy halo. Consequently, studying how galaxies form and evolve is a rich and complicated endeavor that can no longer be fully modeled using just analytical theory. The dynamic scale that needs to be resolved in order to self-consistently study galaxies is enormous and spans many orders of magnitudes, necessitating the use of high performance computing and sophisticated codes that can utilize various different HPC programming models. </p>

								<p>Naively, the N-body problem can be solved by considering all pairs of individual points and adding up the contributions from all such particle-particle interactions. Nonetheless, this approach scales quadratically with the number of particles N: the running time is O(\(N^2\)). Most realistic galaxy simulations require upwards of hundreds of millions of resolution elements. The \(N^2\) scaling of the naive approach would make computations at that scale simply not feasible. Consequently, astronomers have come up with various approximate methods to calculate the forces in the N-body problem, such as tree-based methods (<a href="#Citations">Barnes and Hut 1986</a>) and particle mesh methods (<a href="#Citations">Darden et al. 1993</a>). For our project, we will be focusing on parallelizing the Barnes-Hut (BH) algorithm. </p>

								<h2>The Barnes-Hut Algorithm</h2>
								<br>
								<br>
								<p>The BH algorithm and various modifications of the original algorithm have been extensively used in astrophysical simulations (e.g., <a href="#Citations">Katz et al. 1995, Wadsley et al. 2004, Springel et al. 2005 </a>). The fundamental assumption in all variants of the BH algorithm is that the gravitational pull of many far-away bodies can be approximated by replacing the group of many distant bodies with a single object located at the center of mass and encompassing the total mass of those bodies
									<!--as the gravitational pull due to a single body located at the center of mass of those far-away body and with a magnitude 
								 with a mass that totals the sum of all masses of the far-away bodies located at the center of mass of that set of far-away bodies--> (<a href="#Citations">Barnes and Hut 1986</a>). </p>
								

								
								<p> Barnes and Hut represented this idea using the Octree data structure. In octrees, each internal node has exactly eight child nodes. Octrees have been used in various domains to partition a three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing the space into octants. The figure shown below is an illustration of the 2-dimensional version of the same problem using quadtrees instead of octrees. The upper left quadrant has been recursively subdivided into 4 nodes at each level, until each leaf in the tree contains at most one particle. In this example, we needed 4 levels in the tree in order to fully subdivide the upper left quadrant.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/octree1.png"  /></span>
								<p>  By grouping distant particles together, the far-field approximation requires significantly fewer floating point operations than the naive force calculation. Barnes and Hut found that this approach scales as O(NlogN), where the tree traversal takes roughly log(N) operations and calculating the force for the N particles in the system requires N operations. </p>
								<p>We will exemplify this by computing the force exerted on the particle highlighted in red in the upper right corner. Particles in orange squares are sufficiently far away from the target particle that we can group them based on their center of mass and apply the far-field force approximation. However, the green particle is sufficiently close to the target particle such that we will instead compute the precise gravitational force exerted by this particle. In total, Barnes-Hut required only 5 force calculations instead of 23 using the exact particle-particle force calculations.

								<h2>Code Implementation</h2>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<div id="Octree">
								<br>
								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Octree</font></h4>
								<p>There are two main algorithms required to calculate the force calculation using an octree: building the tree and traversing the tree to calculate the force on a single body. The pseudocode for these two algorithms is presented below. </p>

								<pre><code>
		function <font color="dark red">insertParticle</font>(<font color="lime"><font color="#32CD32">particle</font></font>, <font color="cyan">node</font>)
			if(<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>.position is not in <font color="cyan">node</font>.box): # if particle is not in node's bounding box
				return # end function
			if(<font color="cyan">node</font> has no particles):
				<font color="cyan">node</font>.<font color="#32CD32">particle</font> = <font color="#32CD32">particle</font> # particle is now assigned to node
			if(<font color="cyan">node</font> is an internal node):
				updateCenterOfMass(<font color="cyan">node</font>) # update center of mass of node
				updateTotalMass(<font color="cyan">node</font>) # update total mass of node
				for child in <font color="cyan">node</font>.children: 
					insertParticle(<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>, child) # insert particle into the appropriate child node
			if(<font color="cyan">node</font> is an external node): # if node already has another particle associated with it
				createChildren(<font color="cyan">node</font>) # subdivide this node into its 8 children
				for child in <font color="cyan">node</font>.children: 
					insertParticle(<font color="cyan">node</font>.<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>, child) # insert the existing node.particle into the appropriate child node
				for child in node.children: 
					insertParticle(<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>, child) # insert particle into the appropriate child node
						</code></pre>
								<p> The <font color="dark red">insertParticle</font> algorithm must be run for every particle in the simulation. The algorithm starts by checking to see if the particle is inside the given node's bounding box. Assuming it is, if the node has no particles, the particle currently being considered will be assigned to the given node. If the node is an internal node (that is, it has child nodes) but has no particles associated with it, we insert the particle into the appropriate child node and update the center of mass and the total mass of the node. If the node is an external node (i.e. it has no children) but already has a particle associated with it, we must first create children for that node and then recursively assign both the particle that was already assigned to the external node and the new particle that we were originally assigning. Once we loop over all particles, each leaf node will have only one particle associated with it. </p>
						<pre><code>
		function <font color="dark red">calculateAcceleration</font>(<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>, <font color="cyan">node</font>, thetaTolerance)
			if(<font color="cyan">node</font>.leaf):
				directAccelCalculation(<font color="cyan">node</font>.particle, <font color="#32CD32">particle</font>) # directly sum this node's particle's force on the particle we're considering
			theta = <font color="cyan">node</font>.size/distance(<font color="cyan">node</font>.com, <font color="#32CD32">particle</font>.position)
			if(theta is less than thetaTolerance):
				farFieldForceCalculation(<font color="cyan">node</font>.mass, <font color="cyan">node</font>.com, <font color="#32CD32">particle</font>) # far field approximation is valid
			else: # far field approximation is not valid
				for child in <font color="cyan">node</font>.chilren: 
					calculateAcceleration(<font color="#32CD32">particle</font>, child, thetaTolerance)
					
								</code></pre>
								<p> <font color="dark red">calculateAcceleration</font> takes in the particle we want to calculate the force for, the node we are currently comparing against, and thetaTolerance (the opening angle). The algorithm first starts by checking whether the node we are currently comparing against is a leaf node. If it is, it holds only one particle and we must directly calculate the gravitational influence of this particle on the the particle we passed in as an argument. If the current node is not a leaf, we calculate the opening angle theta (given by the size of the node divided by the distance from the node to the particle). If the opening angle is less than some pre-defined thetaTolerance (most codes in literature use 0.5), the far field approximation is valid and we can group all the particles belonging to this node and compute the gravitational influence of this group on the particle we want to calculate the acceleration for. If the far field approximation is not valid, we must open up the node and call calculateAcceleration for all children of the original node. </p> 
								
								<p> Through experimentation, we found that there was a significant amount of overhead associated with the original Python version of calculateAcceleration. Therefore, we optimized the force calculation using Cython. The speed-ups with the Cython version are shown in the Analysis section. </p>


								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
								<div id="Leapfrog">
								<br>
								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Leapfrog Algorithm</font></h4>
								<p>
								  Once the forces are calculated, we use the <a href="https://www.physics.drexel.edu/students/courses/Comp_Phys/Integrators/leapfrog/">Leapfrog Algorithm</a> to update the positions and velocities. The Leapfrog
								  integration algorithm is a symplectic (i.e. time-reversible) method for solving the set of differential equations
								  given by Newton's laws:<br>

								  \(v = \frac{dx}{dt}\) <br>
								  
								  \(F = m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}\)<br>

								  Because it is symplectic, the Leapfrog Algorithm is guaranteed to conserve energy (to reasonable precision,
								  determined by the time step chosen). Even though it is a first-order integrator, it performs better than
								  higher-order algorithms (like 4th order Runge-Kutta) at conserving energy over many time steps.

								  The algorithm is nearly identical to the Euler method, except the velocities and positions are computed at
								  half-timestep offsets:

								  <span class="image fit"><img src="images/leapfrog.jpg" style="max-width: 300px; margin-left:auto;
								  margin-right:auto;" /></span>

								  Therefore, there is an initial self-start phase of a half-step:<br>
								  \(a_0 = F(x_0) / m \)<br>
								  \(v_{\frac{1}{2}} = v_0 + a_0 \frac{dt}{2} \)<br>
								  \(x_1 = x_0 + v_{\frac{1}{2}} dt\)<br>
								  followed by the regular Euler updating kick-drift steps:<br>
								  \(a_1 = F(x_1) / m \)<br>
								  \(v_{\frac{3}{2}} = v_{\frac{1}{2}} + a_1 dt\)<br>
								  \(x_2 = x_1 + v_{\frac{3}{2}} dt\)<br>

								  We discuss the choice of timestep that results in acceptable levels of energy error <a href="#Accuracy">below</a>.

								</p>
								</div>
								<div id="ParallelCode">
								<br>
								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Parallel Algorithm</font></h4>
								<p> Each step of the N-body integration algorithm has the following structure:
								  <ol>
								    <li> Build the Octree </li>
								    <li> For each particle: compute the total force by traversing the Octree </li>
								    <li> Update the velocities and positions using LeapFrog time integration algorithm </li>
								  </ol>

								  We approach the parallelization of the entire code using a hybrid approach, combining MPI and CUDA. The major
								  limiting step is Step (1), the creation of the Octree, which is <em>not parallelized</em> without significant
								  changes to the algorithm (see below for suggested improvements). Therefore, the entire catalog of simulate d
								  particles is loaded into an individual process at the beginning of each timestep, before the tree is
								  created. <br><br> For step (2), once the tree is created, we use MPI to broadcast the entire tree to a system of
								  distributed-memory processes. The simulated particles are then distributed nearly exactly evenly (to within \(\pm
								  1\) particle) across the processes, and the force calculation occurs in parallel. As
								  discussed <a href="Scaling">below</a>, the force calculation is initially one of the most computationally
								  demanding portions of the code, but this is conveniently the most trivially parallelizable portion, as
								  distributing particles onto more processes nearly linearly reduces the execution time. <br><br> The second phase
								  of parallelization comes in step (3), as we implemented the time integration step on GPUs using PyCUDA. The
								  velocity and positions are updated for each particle in parallel on the GPU processors, which theoretically should
								  provide significant speed-up. However, there are non-trivial overheads involved in moving to GPU acceleration. For
								  one, the communication overhead of sending data to/from the GPU over the PCI-e bus can be significant, and
								  speed-ups over basic Python implementation may not be seen unless a very large number of particles are used. <br><br> In
								  addition, the number of GPUs available on a given node are typically much smaller (around 2, when available at
								  all) than the number of CPUs. This means that for a fixed number of nodes, there may be as many as 32 times more
								  CPUs available than GPUs. If all CPUs are being used to distribute MPI processes, then many processes will need to
								  bind to the same GPUs, which limits the overall scalability of the GPU algorithm. In the
								  sections <a href="#Scaling">below</a> we examine these potential limitations, ultimately finding that the GPU
								  acceleration of the time integration step does not significantly improve the execution time in our tests, likely
								  because too few particles were used to overcome the overheads.
								  <br><br>
								  Including the communication overheads, the final parallel algorithm has the following steps:
								  <ol>
								    <li> Build the Octree (on primary MPI node)</li>
								    <ul>
								      <li> Octree is broadcast to all MPI nodes</li>
								    </ul>
								    <li> For each particle: compute the total force by traversing the Octree </li>
								    <ul>
								      <li> Particle positions and velocities are distributed across MPI nodes</li></ul>
								    <li> Update the velocities and positions using LeapFrog time integration algorithm (on the GPU) </li>
								    <ul>   <li> Particle positions, velocities, and accelerations are transferred to the GPU</li>
								    <li> Updated particle data retrieved from GPU </li></ul>
								      <li> Entire particle catalogs are sent back to the primary MPI node</li>
								      </ul>

								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Initial conditions - Plummer sphere</font></h4>
								<p>We will test our code by simulating an elliptical galaxy, modeled by the Plummer density profile.</p>

									<!--<div class="box alt">

										</div>
									</div>-->

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/elliptical_Plummer.jpg" alt="" /></span>Galaxies in our Universe come in a variety of shapes and colors, and they are often subdivided into two main classes: elliptical glaxies and spiral galaxies. The number of elliptical galaxies is higher in the densest regions of galaxy clusters, and overall, ellipticals tend to have redder colors and much lower star formation rates than spiral galaxies.</p>
								<p>The Plummer model (<a href="#Citations">Plummer 1911</a>) was initially developed for globular star clusters, yet it is often applied to the study of elliptical galaxies due to its relatively simple form and analytic solution for the distribution function.</p>
								<p>The Plummer 3D density profile is given by:
								<br>
								\(\rho(r) = \left(\frac{3M}{4\pi a^3}\right) \left( 1 + \frac{r^2}{a^2}\right)^{-5/2}\)
									<br>
									where M is the total mass of the galaxy, and a is the Plummer radius - a scale parameter which sets the size of the cluster core.</p>
								<p>The mass enclosed within radius r is:
									<br>
									\( M(\lt r) = 4 \pi \int_0^r r^2 \rho (r) dr = M \frac{r^3}{(r^2 + a^2)^{3/2}} \) </p>
								<p> The Plummer model has a distribution function \(f(E)\) that has an analytic expression - it is a polytrope with index \(n=5\) (see, for e.g., <a href="#Citations">Binney & Tremaine 2011</a>) and the distribution function for polytropes follows:
								<br>
								\(f(E) \propto |E|^{n-3/2} \Rightarrow f(E) \propto |E|^{7/2}\) for Plummer 
								<br>
								Thus, the probability for a particle to have absolute velocity \(v\) at radius \(r\) from the center of the galaxy is:
								<br>
								\(g(v) dv \propto |E|^{7/2} v^2 dv \)
								<br>
								Letting \( x \equiv v/v_{esc}\) , where the escape velocity of a particle in the Plummer model is:
								<br>
								\(v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{a}} \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{r}{a}\right)^2\right]^{-1/4}\)
								<br>
								allows us to simplify the expressions for the energy per unit mass \(E \propto (x^2 - 1)\) and the probability for a particle at radius r to have velocity v: \( g(x) \propto x^2 (1-x^2)^{7/2}\) </p> 
								<p> Based on the discussion in <a href="#Citations">Aarseth et al. (1974)</a>, we use the rejection technique to generate random pairs of values \((g_0, x_0)\), where \(x_0\) is between 0 and 1 (implying initial particle velocities between 0 and \(v_{esc}\)), and the velocity probability function \(g\) is allowed to vary between 0 and \(g_{max} \simeq 0.1\). The name of the rejection technique comes from the fact that only those pairs of values for which \(g_0 \leq g(x_0)\) will be kept. This method ensures that, as long as we sample a sufficiently large number of particles, their final velocity distribution will follow \(g(x)\).</p>
								<p>We simulated an elliptical galaxy with a total mass of \(10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot\) and half-light radius of roughly 50 kpc. This elliptical galaxy is thus approximately 100 times more massive than our own Milky Way galaxy (which is a disk galaxy). Most of our test runs involve \(10^3 - 10^5\) particles, and therefore, we chose a softening length of 0.01 kpc (for more details on choosing a good softening length value, see for e.g. <a href="#Citations">Athanassoula et al. 2000</a>). We also ran tests simulating the merger between two equal mass \(10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot\) elliptical galaxies, which are shown in the <a href="index.html#Movies">movies</a> section.</p>

								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Physical Performance and Model Accuracy</font></h4>
								<p> To test the accuracy of our code, we compute the relative total energy change over a large number of time steps. The figure below shows the change in the total energy of the system with respect to the initial total energy, i.e., \((E(t)-E(t=0))/E(t=0)\), for an elliptical galaxy modeled using 1000 particles and with a total mass of \(10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot\). In both cases, we ran our code for 1000 time steps, but with a different time step size: 0.1 Myr shown in orange and 0.01 Myr shown in blue. We find that for a time step of 0.01 Myr, our relative total energy change saturates at the percent level, providing us with a sufficiently accurate method to run long simulations. We note that the relative error in the total energy conservation will change as a function of the time step size, the choice of softening length (which we set at 0.01 kpc in order to avoid false scatterings between particles very close to each other), and the \(\theta\) parameter for the Barnes-Hut algorithm (discussed below).

								<p>The accuracy of the Barnes-Hut algorithm is strongly related to the choice of distances over which we apply the far-field force approximation. Let's consider the distance to the center of an octree cell to be \(D\) and the width of the said cell to be \(L\). A critical parameter of the BH algorithm is \(\theta = L/D\). This is an adjustable parameter, which tells the algorithm that for particles sufficiently far away such that \(L/D \lt \theta\), those particles should be approximated by their center of mass. Naively, setting \(\theta = 0\), reduces the Barnes-Hut algorithm to an exact particle-particle force calculation, because no particles will be sufficiently far away to satisfy the requirement \(L/D \lt \theta\). As we increase \(\theta\) more and more, the algorithm speeds up significantly, yet the relative error in the force computation also increases. These trends are shown in the figure below. We ran several tests with values of \(\theta\) ranging from 0 to 2, and we decided that a value of \(\theta = 0.5\) gives us a good compromise between the running time and the force computation error (\(\sim 10^{-3}\) for \(\theta=0.5\)). </p>

								<p>Based on the discussion above, the following simulations were run using a time step \(\Delta t = 0.01\) Myr, far-field force approximation parameter \(\theta = 0.5\), and softening length of 0.01 kpc.</p>

							<p>The figure below shows the scaling between the median time step of our BH code and the total number of particles in the simulation. We are showing a range of tests with 2 cores per node and 2 GPUs per node, with the total number of particles being [1000, 4000, 10000, 16000, 100000]. We also include in black a series of serial runs, and in light blue we show our results when utilizing the maximum number of cores and GPUs available on holyseasgpu on Odyssey.</p>

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4><font color="#bb99ff">Advanced features</font></h4>
								<p>We found that a pure Python implementation of the force calculation came with many overheads due to looping in Python. Instead, we wrote a Cython version of the force calculation and traversal to mitigate this. We found that, on average, the Cython version performed three times faster than the pure Python version. </p>
								<p>Moreover, binding all the GPUs on a single node "BEN WRITES STUFF HERE" </p>

								<p> Below are two movies exmplifying the type of simulation runs we tested in our project. These are showing the evolution of (1) a \(10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot\) elliptical galaxy and (2) the merger between two \(10^{14} \mathrm{M}_\odot\) galaxies, using our parallel implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm.</p>
